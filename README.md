# Survey / Feedback Form

A beginner-friendly Survey / Feedback Form built using pure HTML.  
This project is part of my frontend learning journey and focuses on understanding basic HTML form elements, page structure, and simple UI wireframing.  
Future updates may include CSS styling and JavaScript validation.
